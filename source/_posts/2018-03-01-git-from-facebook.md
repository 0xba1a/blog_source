There are multiple J.A.R.V.I.S projects available in GitHub. All are based on some chat frameworks like api.ai, Alexa, etc. This is yet another rather vaguely intelligent system that I developed for Facebook developer circle challenge hosted at [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/lucius-fox-github-assistant-bot).

I have developed it just keeping J.A.R.V.I.S in mind. First of all J.A.R.V.I.S is not a simple t-shirt throwing bot like the one Zuckerberg developed. Tony Stark actively uses him during his project development. I mean he is not just a personal assistant but an intelligent co-developer. So I developed one to help you doing your GitHub related activities. You can simply create repos, open close issues, comment on others' issues just from a Facebook chat window. It will save your time and effort from navigating to multiple windows and clicking a dozens of buttons. With voice interface enabled for Facebook chat, he will be your personal J.A.R.V.I.S.

Here is a quick demo.
